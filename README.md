# [Tabletop Sinatra](https://tabletop-sinatra.herokuapp.com/)

A Sinatra app featuring several puzzle type games. Aim was to build a front-end for some previous projects created in Ruby, namely [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/syichi/odin-ruby-fundamentals/tree/master/ruby-building-blocks) and [Serial Hangman](https://github.com/syichi/serial-hangman), refactor them into a Sinatra back-end and build the routes to tie everything together.

Plays the 3 games: Guesser, Caesar Cipher, and Hangman.

The goal for learning some Sinatra before diving into Rails completely, is to look at how some of the underlying Rails "magic" is implemented. Sinatra's bare bones framework allows the ability to make the things that Rails already does for you. In this way, this project helps to mainly look at the utilization of routes, views, and sessions.
